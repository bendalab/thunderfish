### analyse_pulse_data with the .WAV file as input produces:
eods5_70914L01_F15_1742.npy -- numpy array with results from analyze_pulse_data

### this eodsfile can be fed to analyzeEods_lowpass.py to analyze the frequencies and amplitudes and produce the plots over the length of the full recordings... 


70914L01_F15_1742_freqs2_lp.npy -- computed frequencies, meaned over seconds/half seconds
70914L01_F15_1742_amps2_lp.npy -- computed amplitudes, averaged over seconds/...
-- Numpy 2d-arrays, first axis : different fish classes, second axis: timesteps (seconds/half_seconds)

70914L01_F15_1742_AmpFreq7_lp.pdf -- pdf with plotted EOD-amplitudes and frequencies, no classes plotted, highest number is latest version, lp = lowpass smoothing

foraging_ ... npz file with status far, near, on,  each np.nan for not this status and 1 if it has the status at a given timestep, same time resolution as freqs / amps - files 

ontimes, other files - outdated
